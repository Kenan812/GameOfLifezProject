///  DESCRIPTION

Main action of the game will be done on board. The board is represented as a structure with the 
number of rows, columns and the actual board itself. There will be 2 additional rows and columns 
to indicate the border in order to not check the border manually inside the program. The board is 
2d int pointer. Each cell has its own value.
    Cell value for board:
        0-dead cell
        1-alive cell
        2-border


2 versions of the game are be available: clipped and circular. 
    Clipped:   board borders are bounded 
    Circular:  board borders are continuous (not bounded)
